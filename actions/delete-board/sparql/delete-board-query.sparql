Based on the Prisma query and the given schema, a corresponding SPARQL DELETE WHERE query could look like this:

```sparql
PREFIX swco: <http://www.seiri.studio/swco/>
DELETE { 
  ?board ?p ?o .
} 
WHERE { 
  ?board a swco:Board; 
         swco:id "${id}";
         swco:orgId "${orgId}".
  ?board ?p ?o.
}
```

This query will delete a table (together with all its triples) in your graph where the `id` and `orgId` values match the placeholders `"${id}"` and `"${orgId}"` respectively.

Please replace `"${id}"` and `"${orgId}"` with actual values when you use this query.

This query assumes that there are properties `swco:id` and `swco:orgId` associated with the `swco:Board` class in your schema, which would need to be defined. It also assumes a flat data structure for the board object.

Note that SPARQL queries operate on RDF triplestores, so the structure and accessibility of your data can significantly impact the design and effectiveness of your SPARQL queries.
