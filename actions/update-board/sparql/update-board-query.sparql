As a note of context, while Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system that works directly with SQL databases, SPARQL is a query language used for querying RDF (Resource Description Framework) databases. Hence, it might not be possible to translate a Prisma query directly into SPARQL due to the differences in data model (Relational vs RDF).

Given this, here's a possible template for a SPARQL UPDATE query that mirrors the Prisma query's behavior:

```sparql
# SPARQL UPDATE statement
PREFIX swco: <http://www.seiri.studio/swco/> .
DELETE { 
  ?board swco:title ?oldTitle .
}
INSERT {
  ?board swco:title "${title}" .
} 
WHERE { 
  ?board a swco:Board ;
    swco:id "${id}" ;
    swco:orgId "${orgId}" ;
    swco:title ?oldTitle .
}
```

In this query, it is assumed that `swco:title`, `swco:id`, and `swco:orgId` are predicates associated with the board entity. `"${title}"`, `"${id}"`, and `"${orgId}"` are placeholders that ought to be replaced with actual values in your code.

Remember, this query might need to be adjusted based on your actual graph structure.
