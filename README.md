## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker**: [Download and Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Git**: [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```

*Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL of your repository and `<your-repo-directory>` with the name of the directory.*

### 2. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store environment variables securely.

```bash
touch .env
```

Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add the following content:

```dotenv
# .env
ELASTIC_USERNAME=elastic
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
```

**Important:** Replace `your_secure_password` with a strong password of your choice.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary project dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start Elasticsearch

Use the provided npm script to start Elasticsearch using Docker. This command will run Elasticsearch in detached mode.

```bash
npm run es:start
```

**What It Does:**

- Pulls the Elasticsearch Docker image (version 8.9.0).
- Sets up environment variables for Elasticsearch.
- Exposes ports `9200` (HTTP) and `9300` (transport).
- Persists Elasticsearch data in a Docker volume named `es_data`.

### 5. Wait for Elasticsearch to be Ready

Before performing any operations, ensure that Elasticsearch is fully up and running.

```bash
npm run wait-for-es
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Elasticsearch is up and running.
```

*If Elasticsearch isn't ready yet, the script will retry for a specified number of times before exiting with an error.*

### 6. Import Data into Elasticsearch

Perform a bulk import of your JSON data into Elasticsearch using the provided npm script.

```bash
npm run es:import
```

**What It Does:**

- Starts Elasticsearch (if not already running).
- Waits for Elasticsearch to be ready.
- Executes the `import-data.js` script located in `utils/scripts/`.
- Reads all JSON files from `utils/json-output/`.
- Uploads data to the corresponding Elasticsearch indices.
- Utilizes optional mapping files from `utils/json-output/mappings/` if available.

**Note:** Ensure that your JSON files are correctly formatted and located in `utils/json-output/`.

### 7. Replace an Existing Index

To replace a specific Elasticsearch index, use the following command. Replace `<indexName>` with the name of the index you want to replace.

```bash
npm run es:replace-index -- <indexName>
```

**Example:**

```bash
npm run es:replace-index -- users
```

**What It Does:**

- Starts Elasticsearch (if not already running).
- Waits for Elasticsearch to be ready.
- Executes the `replace-index.js` script located in `utils/scripts/`.
- Deletes the existing index named `<indexName>`.
- Creates a new index with optional mappings from `utils/json-output/mappings/<indexName>_mapping.json`.
- Uploads the new data from `utils/json-output/<indexName>.json`.

**Note:** Ensure that the corresponding JSON and mapping files exist in the `utils/json-output/` directory.

### 8. Check Elasticsearch Status

Verify that Elasticsearch is running and check its status.

```bash
npm run es:status
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Name          Command               State    Ports
------------------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch docker-entrypoint.sh  Up       0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9300->9300/tcp
```

*This output confirms that Elasticsearch is up and running, and the necessary ports are exposed.*

### 9. Stop Elasticsearch

When you're done working with Elasticsearch, you can stop and remove the Elasticsearch container using the following command:

```bash
npm run es:stop
```

**What It Does:**

- Stops the Elasticsearch Docker container.
- Removes the container from your system.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Elasticsearch Credentials:**  
  - **Username:** `elastic`  
  - **Password:** Defined in your `.env` file (`ELASTIC_PASSWORD`)
  
  *Ensure that you keep your credentials secure and do not share the `.env` file.*

- **Port Conflicts:**  
  - **Elasticsearch Ports:** `9200` (HTTP), `9300` (transport)  
  - **Kibana (Optional):** If you decide to add Kibana, it typically uses port `5601`.  
  - *Ensure that these ports are not in use by other services on your machine to avoid conflicts.*

- **Data Persistence:**  
  - Elasticsearch data is persisted in a Docker volume named `es_data`.  
  - To reset the data (e.g., for a fresh start), you can remove the Docker volume:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

- **Adding New Indices:**
  - **JSON Data Files:** Place your JSON data files in `utils/json-output/`.
  - **Mapping Files:** If you have custom mappings, place them in `utils/json-output/mappings/` with the naming convention `<indexName>_mapping.json`.
  - Use the import or replace scripts to manage the indices as needed.

- **Environment Variables Security:**  
  - **`.env` File:** Ensure that the `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.
  - **Sensitive Data:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in scripts or configuration files. Always use environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or while running the commands, refer to the following troubleshooting tips.

### Elasticsearch Not Starting

- **Ensure Docker is Running:**  
  - Verify that Docker is installed and the Docker daemon is active.
  
    ```bash
    docker info
    ```
  
  - *If Docker isn't running, start it via your system's applications menu or command line.*

- **Check Port Availability:**  
  - Ensure that ports `9200` and `9300` are not being used by other applications.
  
    ```bash
    lsof -i :9200
    lsof -i :9300
    ```
  
  - *If ports are in use, terminate the conflicting applications or adjust the port settings in `docker-compose.yml`.*

- **Review Docker Logs:**  
  - Inspect the Elasticsearch Docker container logs for any error messages.
  
    ```bash
    docker logs elasticsearch
    ```

### Import Errors

- **Invalid JSON Format:**  
  - Ensure that all JSON files in `utils/json-output/` are properly formatted. Use a JSON validator to check for syntax errors.

- **Missing Mapping Files:**  
  - If you have custom mappings, ensure that the corresponding mapping files exist in `utils/json-output/mappings/`.

- **Authentication Issues:**  
  - Verify that the credentials in your `.env` file match those used by the scripts and `docker-compose.yml`.

### Environment Variables Issues

- **Variables Not Loaded:**  
  - Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly named and located in the root directory.
  - Restart your terminal or IDE if environment variables aren't recognized.

- **Incorrect Values:**  
  - Double-check the values in your `.env` file for typos or incorrect information.

### General Tips

- **Update Dependencies:**  
  - Ensure that all npm dependencies are up-to-date.
  
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- **Rebuild Docker Images (If Necessary):**  
  - If you've made changes to `docker-compose.yml` or Docker configurations, rebuild the Docker images.
  
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

  ```

- **Perform Bulk Import of Data:**

  ```bash
  npm run es:import
  ```

- **Replace a Specific Index:**
