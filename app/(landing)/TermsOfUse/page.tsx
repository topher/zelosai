            claims for arbitration filed by or on behalf of one or more
            claimants; (ii) which involves common questions of law or fact;

            arbitration demands being asserted against the same defendant(s);
            and (iv) is initiated at or near the same time. You and Zelos agree
            that this Class Action Waiver and Collective Arbitration Waiver
            shall be binding in any arbitral proceeding. No arbitrator shall
            have the authority to consolidate, join, or allow the coordination
            of more than one (1) person&rsquo;s claims or to preside over a
            class, collective, mass, or representative proceeding in any form.
            No arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the
            enforceability of this Section IX.B. If you or Zelos brings a claim
            in small claims court, the Class Action Waiver will apply, and
            neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.
            Furthermore, neither you nor Zelos may participate in a class or
            representative action as a class member if the class action asserts
            Disputes that would fall within the scope of this arbitration
            agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Zelos. We both
            agree that this Class Action Waiver is an essential part of our
            arbitration agreement and that if this Class Action Waiver is found
            to be unenforceable by any court then the entire arbitration
            agreement set forth in this Section IX will not apply to any Dispute
            between you and Zelos, except for the provisions of Section IX.F
