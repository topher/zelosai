[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The Beneteau Oceanis 35.1 is a development of the Beneteau Oceanis 35 . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] Production [ edit ] The design was built by Beneteau in France , starting in 2017, but by 2021 it was out of production. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Design [ edit ] Beneteau Oceanis 35.1 sailing with genoa only Beneteau Oceanis 35.1 showing transom with an optional fold down tailgate The Oceanis 35.1 is a recreational keelboat , built predominantly of fiberglass and available in daysailer or cruising configurations. It has a fractional sloop rig, a plumb stem , a plum transom with an optional fold down tailgate, dual internally mounted spade-type rudders controlled by a wheel and a shallow or deep draft fixed fin keel or a stub keel with a centerboard . In cruiser configuration it displaces 12,195 lb (5,532 kg) and carries 3,436 lb (1,559 kg) of ballast, with the deep draft keel. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 7 ] The shallow keel-equipped version of the boat has a draft of 4.75 ft (1.45 m), the deep keel-equipped version of the boat has a draft of 6.08 ft (1.85 m), while the stub keel and centerboard-equipped version has a draft of 7.58 ft (2.31 m) with the centerboard extended and 3.75 ft (1.14 m) with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] The boat is fitted with an inboard diesel engine of 30 hp (22 kW) for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds 34 U.S. gallons (130 L; 28 imp gal) and the fresh water tank has a capacity of 34 U.S. gallons (130 L; 28 imp gal), with 53 U.S. gallons (200 L; 44 imp gal) optional. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] The design has sleeping accommodation for four to six people, depending on the interior design. All arrangements have a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, combined with either one or two double-berth cabins aft. The galley may be located on either the port or starboard side and is equipped with a two-burner stove and a sink. In all arrangements the head is located just forward of the companionway ladder on the starboard side. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] For downwind sailing the design may be equipped with an asymmetrical spinnaker of 898 sq ft (83.4 m 2 ). [ 1 ] [ 3 ] The design has a hull speed of 7.56 kn (14.00 km/h). [ 3 ] Operational history [ edit ] In a review Boat Test wrote that the \"Beneteau Oceanis 35.1 offers two-cabin and three-cabin arrangements, and a new L-shaped galley that will make cooking easier and safer underway. Her large cockpit proves equally useful for daysailing, cruising, club racing, or entertaining on the hook. An optional fold-out transom makes for easy boarding from the dock, a convenient step into a dinghy for a night ashore, or an ideal snorkeling platform. Twin rudders and wheels are handy in a boat that carries her wide beam well aft.\" [ 7 ] List of sailing boat types Wikimedia Commons has media related to Oceanis 35.1 .
