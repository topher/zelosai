Nesquik Nesquik cocoa powder Product type Powder, syrup, beverage Owner Nestlé Produced by Nestlé Country United States Introduced 1948 ; 76 years ago ( 1948 ) Related brands Nesquik Cereal Markets Worldwide Website nesquik.com Nesquik is a brand of food products made by Swiss company Nestlé . In 1948, Nestlé launched a drink mix for chocolate-flavored milk called Nestlé Quik in the United States ; this was released in Europe during the 1950s as Nesquik . [ 1 ] Since 1999, the brand has been known as Nesquik worldwide. [ 1 ] Today, the Nesquik name appears on a wide range of products, including breakfast cereals , [ 2 ] powdered mixes for flavored milk, [ 3 ] syrups, [ 3 ] ready-to-drink products, [ 3 ] candy bars, fondue fountains, hot chocolate mix, and more. History [ edit ] Nesquik advertisement c. 1960 featuring a young Charles Herbert (1948–2015) Nesquik began as a chocolate powdered flavoring mix in the United States in 1948, as Nestlé Quik. In the 1950s, it was launched in Europe as Nesquik. In countries with the Quik term (including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Australia, where it was originally marketed under the name Nestlé's Quik), the name was changed to the worldwide brand Nesquik in 1999. The same year, Cereal Partners Worldwide introduced Nesquik Cereal , a breakfast cereal that \"turns milk into chocolate milk\", which is similar to Cocoa Puffs . Nesquik syrup products were introduced in 1981 and ready-to-drink products were introduced in 1984. On 8 November 2012, Nestlé USA issued a voluntary recall of limited quantities of Nesquik Chocolate Powder made and sold in the United States. These that were recalled were of the 10.9-, 21.8-, and 40.7-ounce (309 g, 618 g, 1150 g) tins. This recall only affected the chocolate variety; it did not affect the other varieties of the mix or any other Nesquik products. This was the first known recall of a Nesquik product. These tins were taken off the market after Nestlé was informed via a supplier, Omya Inc. that it had issued a recall of certain lots of one of its own products, calcium carbonate for Salmonella contamination. The affected Nesquik chocolate mix was produced during early October 2012. All affected products had an expiration date of Best Before October 2014. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Nestlé issued a statement on the recall stating, \"We apologize to our consumer and sincerely regret this incident.\" [ 9 ] On 1 April 2013, the official Facebook page of Nesquik USA posted a photo on their page depicting a broccoli-flavored ready-to-drink flavor of Nesquik. However, upon closer inspection of the photo, there was a notice in the lower-left corner that it was not an actual Nestlé product. Nesquik USA announced later in the same day that it was an April Fool's joke. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In January 2017, Nestlé food scientists outlined a strategy [ 12 ] to reformulate their drink mix to remove over half of the sugar content, citing consumer backlash against sweetened mixes and beverages. On 26 August 2023, Nestle South Africa announced that the company would discontinue both the Strawberry and Chocolate flavors in the country.

[ 20 ] Nesquik Milk Slice, a sponge cake with chocolate flavor yogurt filling is available in the U.K. Advertising campaigns [ edit ] Nesquik has had hundreds of various advertising campaigns over its long history. It has had ads from print ads to ads at the Tour de France , and Olympics in recent years. It has been advertised with close to one dozen mascots. Jimmy Nelson, Danny O'Day, and Farfel [ edit ] In 1955, Nestlé hired ventriloquist Jimmy Nelson to do its advertising on children's television programming. Nelson's dummy Danny O'Day would say that Quik \"makes milk taste...like a mill-ion \" (dollars). Danny and a dog named Farfel would finish the commercials by singing Nestlé's brand-new signature jingle : Danny : N-E-S-T-L-E-S, Nestlé's makes the very best... Farfel : Choc-'late Farfel would finish with the sound of his jaw snapping shut. This effect was accidentally invented when Nelson's sweaty finger (a result of nervousness) slipped off the mouth control during his first audition in front of the Nestlé executives. This would normally be a serious technical mistake for a ventriloquist, but they actually liked it so much that they insisted that Nelson keep it in. Nelson performed the jingle that way for 10 years. [ 21 ] Nesquik Bunny (a.k.a. Quicky) [ edit ] Main article: Quicky The Nesquik Bunny cosplay at the 2015 Wizard World in Chicago A cartoon Quik Bunny first appeared on the cans of the strawberry flavor when it was introduced. Later, an anthropomorphic animated bunny wearing a large red \" Q \" on a collar -like necklace, was introduced in television commercials as the new chocolate Quik mascot . He debuted in 1960 and first appeared in his first TV commercial in 1973. The character is voiced by Barry Gordon . He sings Nesquik's most famous jingle in a rock-and-roll rhythm: It's so rich and thick and chocolate, That you can't...drink it slow... if it's Quik Then he vocalizes only four notes \"oh-do-be-oh\" and instead of vocalizing the fifth note which is \"doh\", he immediately sucks all of his drink down through a straw, then finishes the rhyme by forlornly intoning, \"That's the saddest sound I know.\" The Nesquik Bunny in an advertisement for Nesquik on a tram in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1996 In the U.S. by 1999, the Quik Bunny was renamed the Nesquik Bunny and his \"Q\" changed to an \"N\" when the brand name was changed. He appears on the packaging and marketing and has appeared in the product's television commercials . The artist who made the redesign of the Bunny for its global implantation in the '90s was the cartoonist Ramon Maria Casanyes. [ 22 ] In France, Italy, and Canada, he is known as Quicky the Nesquik Bunny. In Spain, there was no mascot prior to the introduction of Quicky in 1990/1991. The Nesquik Bunny is also featured on the packaging and advertisements for other Nesquik products. Appearances in other media [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

A 1987 promotional comic with Superman . A 1984 The Adventures of Quik Bunny comic featuring Spiderman. A Quik Bunny balloon had been a staple of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1988 until 1999. Groquik (Quikáras) [ edit ] France and Greece first had another mascot for Nesquik, which was a giant fat yellow hippopotamus-like cartoon creature with a deep voice, wearing a hat with red and white stripes, called Groquik—a variation of Gros Quik (\"Fat Quik\"), created by Gilbert Mast and puppeteered by Yves Brunier . In Greece, the mascot was called Κουικάρας (or Quikáras —English: \"Big Quik\"). He was later replaced by Quicky, much to the discontent of fans who protested against the lack of a sympathetic character and the Americanism. [ citation needed ] The character was created in 1978. His first appearance was in the French magazine Téléjunior in April 1979. The designer of the character was Gilbert Mas. In the French advertisements where Groquik was depicted, he was a puppet character portrayed by renowned French puppeteer Yves Brunier , who manufactured and portrayed puppets as a ventriloquist. He has also created famous characters such as Casimir , L'Île aux enfants , and worked on The Muppet Show . [ 23 ] The Greek character's catchphrase was: \"I have a craving for Nesquik!\" (at the time, this translated into Quik, as the name had not yet been changed) The French character's catchphrase was the same, but in French. These catchphrases were passed on to their successor, the Nesquik Bunny. In the Greek television ads, Quikaras would chase after thieves who kidnapped children, after trying to steal their Quik; the children refused to give their Quik to the thieves, so the thieves stole the children along with the Quik. Quikaras would catch the thieves, saved the children, and returned the Quik to the children. Over the years, this basic advertising format spawned various variations, such as ads where pirates stole Quik and kidnapped children, and they were saved by Kouikaras; another version followed the basic format, but was instead set in space. Many other versions followed this format, and some still follow this format today with the Nesquik Bunny. [ citation needed ] The last ad with Quikaras (which was played in Greece) showed a train at a train station soon to be leaving the station. Quikaras was at the station, and dozens of children at the station said goodbye to Quikaras, soon after he boarded the train, and it began to leave the station. As it left the station, and the children waved goodbye, thieves once again stole the Quik, and Quicky the bunny (who had been at the station the entire time) caught the thieves and returned the Quik back to the children. [ citation needed ] In 2001, Nesquik launched a website, which was dedicated to Groquik. The website contained old Nesquik commercials and advertisements, contests, e-cards, logos, and more. [ citation needed ] Cangurik [ edit ] In Portugal , the mascot was a kangaroo, Cangurik, which was replaced by Quicky in 1989/1990. The song \"Cangurik\" was recorded by Suzy Paula in 1982. Joel Branco recorded \"Uma Árvore, Um Amigo\", with Cangurik on the cover, in 1984. \"Amigos do cangurik\" (1986) was a collection of trading cards. There was a club named \"Clube do Cangurik\". Mr. Nesquik [ edit ] In Italy, before the arrival of Quicky, the mascot was an anthropomorphized box of Nesquik called Mr. Nesquik . [ 24 ] Especially in the 1980s, he represented a popular and easily recognizable advertising character thanks to TV commercials (featuring an iconic jingle based on the music of Oh! Susanna [ 25 ] ), press advertisements (most notably on Topolino comic books), and to the many complimentary gadgets included with every box of Nesquik powdered chocolate throughout the years, all bearing his image. [ 26 ] Mr. Nesquik made his final appearance around 1990, concomitant with Quicky's introduction, for the promotion of a new gadget, the Volaquik, already depicting the latter character, making for a symbolic relay between the two mascots. [ 27 ] Nesquik Cereal [ edit ] Nesquik Cereal is advertised in the 43 countries in which it is sold. [ citation needed ] It is mainly marketed via television, though there have",
