[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In August 2020, Wahaca announced that it would close ten of its 28 restaurants due to a downturn in business caused by the coronavirus pandemic .

[ 20 ] Employment rights [ edit ] In June 2019, Wahaca was criticised for making serving staff pay part of the bills of customers who left without paying .
