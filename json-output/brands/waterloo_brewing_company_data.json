(2023–present) Parent Carlsberg Group (2023–present) Website waterloobrewing .com Cans of Waterloo beer Waterloo Brewing LTD. (formerly the Brick Brewing Co. ) is a brewery based in Kitchener , Ontario , Canada, with several divisions. The company is reportedly the largest Canadian-owned brewer in the province, and it was also Ontario's first modern craft brewery . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Waterloo's most successful brand is the Laker series. It also operates LandShark Lager Canada and Waterloo Brewing; the latter is their craft brewing division. [ 3 ] In mid-2019, the company announced that it would change the corporate name from Brick to Waterloo Brewing Ltd. [ 4 ] In December 2022, the company announced that it was being acquired by Carlsberg Group . [ 5 ] On March 7, 2023, Carlsberg completed the acquisition of Waterloo Brewing through its Canadian subsidiary. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Overview [ edit ] The company's administration currently consists of president and CEO George Croft and COO Russell Tabata. Founder Jim Brickman resigned in 2008. [ 8 ] In the early 1990s, Waterloo briefly produced Pride Lager, Canada's first beer marketed specifically to gay consumers. [ 9 ] Pride Lager was not a new product, however, but simply one of the company's existing brews bottled and sold under an alternate label. [ 9 ] In January 2017, Waterloo put its Formosa Springs Brewery in Formosa, Ontario , up for sale; that resulted in the re-opening of the 40,000 square foot plant after the new owner was interested in retaining the facility. In addition to the Formosa brand, Waterloo also sold the Red Baron lines. [ 10 ] Waterloo planned to consolidate its operations in Kitchener and expand the plant, at an estimated cost of $4 million. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In late 2018, the company announced a plan to invest $9.6 million in a tasting room, small-batch brewhouse, expanded warehouse and production facility and an expanded retail store at its Bingemans Centre Drive operation. This is said to bring its investment to nearly $30 million CAD in five years. [ 13 ] After all of the projects are completed, the company's investment over the previous six years will have totaled about $45 million.
