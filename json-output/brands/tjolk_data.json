( March 2023 ) Tjolk Type Flavored milk Country of origin Netherlands Introduced 1977 Discontinued 1992, 2010 and 2015 Flavor Chocolate, strawberry and banana Tjolk was a Dutch milk drink that was created by Coberco and sold from 1977 to 1984 and was revived in 2010 and 2013. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Information [ edit ] The drink was first sold in the Netherlands in 1977. It was marketed with the slogan, \"Tjolk is lekker, overal en altijd!\" (Tjolk is tasty, everywhere and always!). [ 3 ] The packaging for the drink featured colorful cartoon drawings of animals including cows, bunnies, monkeys and bears [ 3 ] and the brand had many commercials aimed at children. [ 2 ] The original drink was a sweet drink with various additives. [ 4 ] The brand was discontinued in 1992 when Coberco merged with Friesland Foods with concerns of the brand needing updated and being unable to compete with the more successful brand, Chocomél. [ 1 ] The brand was purchased by Sjoerd Stouten in 2010 from Friesland Foods [ 5 ] as he felt the brand still had name value, [ 6 ] but the revival was unsuccessful. [ 7 ] Tjolk was removed from stores after it became known that it could spoil prematurely. Customers were warned not to drink the products and to throw them away. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] An entrepreneur named Niek Nielen from the Galatrada company bought the rights to the brand in 2013. [ 4 ] Changes were made to the drink, as it only used natural ingredients and had less sugar with real fruits being used instead. [ 4 ] The brand hit the shelves in 2014 with three flavors - chocolate, banana and strawberry. [ 10 ] The brand was supposed to build on nostalgia. [ 11 ] Nielen had also planned to expand the brand to Belgium, Germany and France. [ 12 ] The brand won an award for best product of the year in 2014–15. [ 13 ] The brand managed to get into 1500 stores, however, the success was short lived. The brand was discontinued and sold again in 2015. [ 2 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Tjolk featured advertisements in Donald Duck comic books during its initial run [ 5 ] [ 14 ] Tjolk sponsored a speed skating team in 2015 that was known as \"Team Tjolk\". [ 15 ] One of its athletes, Evert Hoolwerf, won the KPN Cup in 2015.
