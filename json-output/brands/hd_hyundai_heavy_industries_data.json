History [ edit ] HHI shipyard and cranes in Ulsan HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Hangul 에이치디 현대 중공업 Hanja 現代 重工業 Revised Romanization Eichidi Hyeondae Junggongeop McCune–Reischauer Eich'idi Hyŏndae Chunggongŏp HHI was founded in 1972 by Chung Ju-yung as a division of the Hyundai Group , and in 1974, completed building its first ships. [ 5 ] In 2002, the company was spun-off from its parent company. [ 6 ] HHI has four core business divisions: Shipbuilding, Offshore & Engineering, Industrial Plant & Engineering, and Engine & Machinery. HHI also has five non-core related subsidiaries: Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems, Hyundai Construction Equipment, Hyundai Robotics, Hyundai Heavy Industries Green Energy, and Hyundai Global Service. [ 7 ] The Hyundai Group started as a small South Korean construction firm in 1947, headed by its founder, Korean entrepreneur Chung Ju-yung. [ 8 ] Another widely known and closely related Korean company, the Hyundai Motor Company , was founded in 1967, five years prior to the founding of the Heavy Industry Group. The motor company was also founded by Chung. The company has a partnership with Capital Product Partners to create four specialized ships with equipment for ocean-based carbon capture and storage to be delivered in 2025 and 2026 and at a cost of $300 million. [ 9 ] The name is an informal romanisation of the Korean 현대 ( hyeondae ) meaning \"contemporary\" or \"modern\", which was Chung's vision for the group of companies that he founded.
