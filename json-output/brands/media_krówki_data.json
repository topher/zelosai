  "body_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Polish confectionery Krówki Type Fudge Place of origin Poland Main ingredients Milk , sugar , cream , butter , vanilla Media: Krówki Krówki ( [ˈkrufki] , plural ; krówka singular ), literally meaning \"little cows,\" are Polish fudge , semi-soft milk toffee candies . When hand-made, they are hard and crispy on the outside, but the inside is more fluid than solid. It is one of the most common Polish confections, sold worldwide, and might be considered \" dulce de leche candy\". Commercially, many brands are available; most of them have each individual candy wrapped in white-and-yellow paper with a picture of a Holstein cow . Widely known across Europe even before the end of the Cold War , they are something of an equivalent of the White Rabbit Creamy Candy famous across East Asia , or Scottish Tablet . The original recipe usually contains milk, sugar, and sometimes butter, cream and vanilla flavor. [ 1 ] There are also fruit (e.g. banana), [ 2 ] cocoa, [ 2 ] coffee, nut, [ 2 ] liquorice [ 2 ] flavored krówki available, as well as versions made from soy milk for lactose intolerant consumers. Krówki can be prepared at home, using a simple cast iron pan and the above-mentioned ingredients. The confectionery company \"L. Pomorski i syn\" claims that the first krówki were produced in Poznań by the Pomorski family, which was later expelled by Nazi Germans to Milanówek near Warsaw during World War II. [ 3 ] In Germany , krówki are often called Muh-Muhs [ 4 ] (after the sound cows make) or Kuhbonbons (cow bonbons). [ 5 ] In Latvia , this candy is called gotiņa and is considered the national candy. Originally it was made at home, and has been produced commercially since 1930s.
