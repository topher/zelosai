  "body_text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Chocolate bar Caramello Koala A Cadbury's Caramello Koala split in half Product type Confectionery Owner Cadbury Australia Country Australia and United Kingdom Introduced 1966 ; 58 years ago ( 1966 ) Markets Australia and United Kingdom Website Cadbury’s Caramello Koala Caramello Koala is a brand of chocolate treat currently manufactured by Cadbury Australia . It consists of a chocolate cartoon koala (named \"George\" in certain advertising material) with a caramel centre. The chocolate bar is sold in two sizes: the more common 15 g (0.53 oz) size and the \"Giant\" 35 g (1.2 oz) size, usually sold as a fundraiser. 50 million Caramello Koalas are sold in Australia each year, making the product the second most popular in the Australian children's confectionery market, after the Freddo Frog . [ 1 ] Cross-over products are occasionally made available featuring the Caramello character, including Cadbury Caramello Koala Choc Caramel flavoured milk in 2003 and Caramello Koala Sundae ice-cream in 1997. They were also sold in South Africa under the name \"Caramello Bear\", where they were marketed with the Caramello Bear admitting: \"Caramel? That's a weakness!\", but they were discontinued in 2012. The Afrikaans slogan for the Caramello Bear in South Africa was \"Met 'n magie propvol caramel\", which translates to \"with a tummy full of caramel\". A 20g Caramello Koala contains 415 KJ (99.1874 kcal) of energy and 5.5 g (0.19 oz) of fat . Caramello Koala was introduced in Australia in 1966. It was reputedly the first mass-marketed confection to be modelled on Australian fauna . Television advertisements for the chocolate in Australia featured Caramello and his cartoon friends sailing down a river or riding on a steam train to a modified version of Donovan 's \" Mellow Yellow \". Caramello's packaging and imagery was updated in 2000, after market research revealed the character was seen as daggy, one-dimensional and not sufficiently 'animated'. [ 1 ] In 2003, then Australian Labor Party MP , Mark Latham , was labelled a \"Caramello Koala\" by Liberal MP Christopher Pyne , for allegedly being \"soft in the centre\". [ 2 ] To deal with rising input costs, in April 2015 Cadbury announced a reduction in size of the 20 g (0.71 oz) chocolate to 15 g (0.53 oz). Despite the 25% size reduction, the price is unchanged. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The giant Caramello Koala has also been reduced from 40 g (1.4 oz) to 35 g (1.2 oz).
