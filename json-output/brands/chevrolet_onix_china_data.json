Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay [ edit ] As engines up to 1.0L are not benefitted with a lower taxation, a naturally-aspirated 1.2L engine always combined with a 5-speed manual transmission is available for the entry-level versions instead of the smaller one offered in Brazil where the Onix for Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay is made. Turbo versions retain the 1.0L displacement, while being offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic.
