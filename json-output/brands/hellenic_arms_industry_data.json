[ 1 ] Its creation is linked to a desire of Greek governments for \"complete self-sufficiency\" of Greece in the areas of personal and other weapons. [ 1 ] It produces rifles (military and civilian) and machine guns, as well as pistols, mortars, ammunition and explosives, rocket launchers, land mines, grenades, anti-aircraft weapons, various types of bombs, cannons, night vision equipment, aircraft metal parts, as well as specialized machinery, tools, uniforms, body armor vests and reinforced composite/plastics. [ 1 ] The company is a weapons exporter. [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Artemis 30 A proposal in 1975 by a big Greek chemical company, Chropei of Piraeus , for the adoption of its rifles and submachine guns was rejected after testing proved that its weapons were not up to standards. Similarly, the Greek state did not support Pyrkal , which was producing the FN FAL rifle under license. EBO was founded by the state in Aigio in 1976, after an agreement to initially produce under licence Heckler & Koch models adopted by the Greek Army, but with the intent to design arms of its own. [ 1 ] During its foundation ceremony, a Greek pistol of the 1820s (used in the Greek Revolution ) was placed on the foundation stone to represent the continuity of Greece's arms-making craft. [ 1 ] Since that time, the company has grown by acquisition. In 2004, it merged with Pyrkal, forming Hellenic Defence Systems , in an effort of the Greek state to better control and regulate this sector of the nation's defence industry. [ 1 ] Its financial state has been shaky almost since its early steps. Products [ edit ] EBO develops its own products (including by founder and designers Athan Calligeris, Ph.D., Anastasios Georgiou, such as the Artemis 30 Anti-Aircraft System and the Aris IV Anti-Tank Rocket) Fairfox 2000 rifle.
