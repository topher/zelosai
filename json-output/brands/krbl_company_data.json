It is best known for its India Gate brand of basmati rice , which is the largest selling rice brand in India. [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The company exports rice to over 80 countries; [ 7 ] about 36% of its export revenue comes from the Middle East countries, as of 2021. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] History [ edit ] KRBL was founded in 1889 in Lyallpur by two brothers–Khushi Ram and Behari Lal; the company name is an acronym of their names. Initially set up as a cotton-spinning (or perhaps cotton ginning) business, it also had business interests in edible oil, wheat and rice. After the partition of India , the family settled in Delhi and started again from scratch, working as trade agents of rice and oil in the city's Naya Bazaar area. [ 10 ] By the 1970s, KRBL was producing only rice, and supplying to local exporters including the Zee Group . The company began exporting rice directly, in its own name, only in 1985. In 1992, it set up its first unit in Ghaziabad , UP , in the outskirts of Delhi. This unit was for sorting, grading and packaging rice. In 1995, KRBL issued its initial public offering . In 1998, the company launched its own brand of rice, \"India Gate,\" in the Indian market. In 1998, the company commissioned its second plant (sorting, grading, packaging of rice) in Alipur, Delhi . In 2001, the third plant was set up in Gautam Buddh Nagar , UP (again in the outskirts of Delhi). [ 2 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In 2003, KRBL became the first Indian rice company to receive foreign investment, and in 2006, it issued GDRs of US$ 13 million. It was also in 2003 that KRBL acquired a 65-acre rice processing, grading and packaging plant near Dhuri for ₹ 15.8 crore through a court auction . The facility was turned into the largest rice milling plant in the world after a ₹ 200 crore upgrade. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2016, the company started operating its fourth plant, located in Sonipat district of Haryana . [ 15 ] Controversy [ edit ] The company was named in a chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in December 2020 in relation to a money laundering case linked with Embraer . [ 16 ] In January 2021, the ED arrested KRBL's joint managing director Anoop Kumar Gupta in connection to the AgustaWestland bribery scandal .
