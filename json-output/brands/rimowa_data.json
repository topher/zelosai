The company was founded in 1898, in Cologne , Germany. Rimowa suitcases are widely known for their parallel aluminium grooves, which have become characteristic of the brand. [ 1 ] The company's headquarters and production have been located in Cologne for 120 years. In October 2016, LVMH purchased an 80% stake in Rimowa, [ 2 ] which became the group's first German company. [ 3 ] From 2017 to 2021, the company was managed by Alexandre Arnault. [ 4 ] Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert took over as CEO in 2021. [ 5 ] History [ edit ] Paul Morszeck Kofferfabrik, 1898 In 1898, Paul Morszeck and Heinrich Görtz founded the company under the name Görtz & Morszeck. By 1900, Paul Morszeck remained as the sole director of the company. In 1931, his son, Richard Morszeck, became involved in the company and registered the trademark Rimowa at the Reich Patent Office in Berlin. \"Rimowa\" is an acronym for Ri chard Mo rszeck Wa renzeichen (with Warenzeichen meaning trademark ). [ citation needed ] In the 1930s, a fire in their factory burned most of their materials, [ 6 ] leaving only aluminum . As a result, the company used metal for cases. In 2000, the company introduced polycarbonate in box construction. In October 2016, Rimowa joined the LVMH Group and became its first German subsidiary, with Alexandre Arnault becoming CEO of the company. [ 7 ] LVMH acquired an 80% stake for 640 million euros. [ 8 ] Chief Brand Officer Hector Muelas and London branding design studio Commission created a new visual identity. [ 9 ] In January 2021, Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert became CEO, [ 5 ] coinciding with the launch of the brand's first line of backpacks and travel bags. [ 10 ] Rimowa produces its products in its own factories in Germany , Czech Republic , and Canada . In 2013, 5,800 cases were produced daily.
