[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Established in November 1996, the Voice started life as the newspaper of Scottish Militant Labour , before being handed over to the Scottish Socialist Party on its formation in 1998. [ 2 ] Alan McCombes , the paper's founding editor, [ 3 ] continued to act as editor until 2003. For a short time afterwards it was edited by Kath Kyle, followed by Joanna Harvie, [ 4 ] and it is currently edited by Ken Ferguson. It was originally launched as a fortnightly publication, and moved to a weekly format in May 2001 [ 5 ] at great financial cost, [ 6 ] before returning to fortnightly production in 2007. In 2009, it changed from a broadsheet to a tabloid format. It is primarily distributed through subscription and street sales. The aims of the Voice , as set out in its first issue, are: To report the struggles of ordinary people against injustice, discrimination and exploitation. To expose corruption and hypocrisy in high places. To cover politics, culture and sport from a socialist standpoint. To champion the cause of an independent socialist Scotland as part of a worldwide fightback against global capitalism. In December 2004, the Voice celebrated its 200th issue. [ 5 ] In November 2006, it celebrated its tenth anniversary. Forum events [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2018 ) Since at least 2013, the Voice has hosted a number of cross-party discussion events called \"Forums\". In December 2013, figures from the pro-independence left were invited to a Forum to discuss Scotland's Future , which was chaired by John Finnie and featured Jim Sillars , John McAllion , Isobel Lindsay , Prof Mike Danson, Maggie Chapman , and Colin Fox on its panel.
